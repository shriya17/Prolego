    This python script fetches each premier league player's EA Sports FIFA ratings for all seasons
    from 2013 onwards. The script scrapes data from the site www.fifaindex.com. The task is achieved by
    performing two tasks - fetching each club's url from the season page & then fetching player ratings
    for each player in the club page.
